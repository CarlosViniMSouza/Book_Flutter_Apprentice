# 3 - Basic Widgets

#### Written by Vincent Ngo

As you know, everything in Flutter is a widget. But how do you know which widget to use when? In this chapter, you’ll explore three categories of basic widgets, which you can use for:

° Structure and navigation

° Displaying information

° Positioning widgets

By the end of this chapter, you’ll use those different types of widgets to build the foundation of an app called *Fooderlich*, a social recipe app. You’ll build out the app’s structure and learn how to create three different recipe cards: the main recipe card, an author card and an explore card.
