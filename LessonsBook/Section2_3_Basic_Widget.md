# 3 - Basic Widgets

#### Written by Vincent Ngo

As you know, everything in Flutter is a widget. But how do you know which widget to use when? In this chapter, you‚Äôll explore three categories of basic widgets, which you can use for:

¬∞ Structure and navigation

¬∞ Displaying information

¬∞ Positioning widgets

By the end of this chapter, you‚Äôll use those different types of widgets to build the foundation of an app called *Fooderlich*, a social recipe app. You‚Äôll build out the app‚Äôs structure and learn how to create three different recipe cards: the main recipe card, an author card and an explore card.

Ready? Dive in by taking a look at the starter project.

# Getting started

Start by downloading this chapter‚Äôs project from the book materials repo https://github.com/raywenderlich/flta-materials.

Locate the projects folder and open starter. If your IDE has a banner that reads ‚ÄòPub get‚Äô has not been run, click Get dependencies to resolve the issue.

Run the app from Android Studio and you‚Äôll see an app bar and some simple text:

*main.dart* is the starting point for any Flutter app. Open it and you‚Äôll see the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  // 1
  runApp(const Fooderlich());
}

class Fooderlich extends StatelessWidget {
  // 2
  const Fooderlich({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // TODO: Create theme
    // TODO: Apply Home widget
    // 3
    return MaterialApp(
      // TODO: Add theme
      title: 'Fooderlich',
      // 4
      home: Scaffold(
        // TODO: Style the title
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Fooderlich')),
        // TODO: Style the body text
        body: const Center(child: Text('Let\'s get cooking üë©‚Äçüç≥')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Take a moment to explore what the code does:

1. Everything in Flutter starts with a widget. `runApp()` takes in the root widget `Fooderlich`.
   
2. Every stateless widget must override the `build()` method.
   
3. The `Fooderlich` widget starts by composing a `MaterialApp` widget to give it a *Material Design* system look and feel. See https://material.io for more details about it.

4. The `MaterialApp` widget contains a `Scaffold` widget, which defines the layout and structure of the app. The scaffold has two properties: an `appBar` and a `body`. An `Appbar`‚Äôs `title` contains a `Text` widget. The `body` has a `Center` widget, whose `child` property is a `Text` widget.
