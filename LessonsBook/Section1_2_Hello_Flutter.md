# Hello, Flutter

#### Written by Michael Katz

Now that you’ve had a short introduction, you’re ready to start your Flutter apprenticeship. Your first task is to build a basic app from scratch, giving you the chance to get the hang of the tools and the basic Flutter app structure. You’ll customize the app and find out how to use a few popular widgets like `ListView` and `Slider` to update its UI in response to changes.

Creating a simple app will let you see just how quick and easy it is to build cross-platform apps with Flutter — and it will give you a quick win.

By the end of the chapter, you’ll have built a lightweight recipe app. Since you’re just starting to learn Flutter, your app will offer a hard-coded list of recipes and let you use a `Slider` to recalculate quantities based on the number of servings.

Here’s what your finished app will look like:

All you need to start this chapter is to have Flutter set up. If the `flutter doctor` results show no errors, you’re ready to get started. Otherwise, go back to Chapter 1, “Getting Started”, to set up your environment.
